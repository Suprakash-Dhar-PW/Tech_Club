<h1>Project Title: IOI Tech Club Portal (Frontend Prototype)</h1>


Description: A visually immersive, cyberpunk-themed landing page designed for the "IOI: Institute of Innovation" student technical club. The website features a high-performance, futuristic UI that blends 3D elements with smooth animations to engage students and showcase the club's hierarchy and domains.

Key Features:

Immersive Hero Section: Features a 3D droid model with holographic overlays and a "glitch" text effect.

Interactive Hierarchy: A "Chain of Command" section using tilt-card effects and dynamic data visualization to display club leadership and domains (Web Dev, AI/ML, Cyber Security, etc.).

Smooth Navigation: A custom-built navbar with smooth scrolling, active state detection, and a mobile-responsive menu.

Cyberpunk Aesthetic: Consistent use of neon cyan/violet gradients, glassmorphism, and tech-inspired typography (Font Tech/Mono).

Tech Stack:

Framework: React.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animations: Framer Motion

Icons: React Icons (FontAwesome)

Note: This project currently represents the Frontend User Interface (UI/UX) only. It demonstrates the visual design and interactivity; backend functionality (such as database connections or form submissions) is not yet connected.









# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
